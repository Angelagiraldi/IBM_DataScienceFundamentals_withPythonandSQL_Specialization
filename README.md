## Description

This repository contains a collection of Jupiter notebooks and code exercises I worked on during the IBM Data Science Fundamentals with Python and SQL Specialization.
Each folder corresponds to a different course within the program and covers various topics and concepts related to data science and its applications.
Each course focuses on specific aspects of data science, such as data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and more.


## Course Content

The IBM Data Science Fundamentals with Python and SQL Specialization is a comprehensive program consisting of several courses, including:



### Course 1: Tools for Data Science

-  ##### Description:
This course focuses on equipping you with the essential tools utilized by Data Science professionals. You will gain proficiency in using popular tools such as Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, RStudio IDE, Git, GitHub, and Watson Studio. Through hands-on experience in a cloud-based environment, you'll learn to work with these tools, including executing code in Python, R, or Scala. The course culminates with a final project where you'll demonstrate your skills by creating a Jupyter Notebook, utilizing Markdown, and sharing your work with peers.

### Course 2: Python for Data Science, AI & Development

-  ##### Description:
This repository contains the code and resources for the Python for Beginners course. The course teaches you the basics of Python, a popular programming language used in data science, data analytics, software development, and other fields. This course is suitable for anyone who wants to learn Python, regardless of their prior programming experience. If you are interested in data science, data analytics, software development, or other fields where Python is used, then this course is for you. By the end of this course, you will be able to:
  * Write basic Python programs
  * Use Python data types and structures
  * Control flow and logic
  * Use Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Beautiful Soup
  * Perform tasks such as data collection and web scraping with APIs

### Course 3: Python Project for Data Science

-   ##### Description:
This project-based course will help you demonstrate your proficiency in Python for data science. You will work with a real-world dataset and scenario to extract data, web scrape, visualize data, and create a dashboard. This project will showcase your skills in Python and using libraries such as Pandas and Beautiful Soup.

-   ##### Folder: `3_PythonProjectDataScience/`


### Course 4: Statistics for Data Science with Python

-   ##### Description:
This course will introduce you to the basic principles of statistical methods and procedures used for data analysis. You will learn how to gather data, summarize data using descriptive statistics, display and visualize data, examine relationships between variables, and conduct hypothesis tests. You will also learn how to use Python and Jupyter Notebooks to perform statistical analysis.

-   ##### Folder: `4_StatisticsDataSciencePython/`

### Course 5: Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

-   ##### Description:
This course will teach you the fundamentals of SQL, a powerful language used for communicating with and extracting data from databases. You will learn how to write foundational SQL statements, filter result sets, use WHERE, COUNT, DISTINCT, and LIMIT clauses, differentiate between DML & DDL, CREATE, ALTER, DROP and load tables, use string patterns and ranges; ORDER and GROUP result sets, and built-in database functions. You will also learn how to build sub-queries and query data from multiple tables, access databases as a data scientist using Jupyter notebooks with SQL and Python, and work with advanced concepts like Stored Procedures, Views, ACID Transactions, Inner & Outer JOINs.

 Through hands-on labs and projects, you will practice building SQL queries, work with real databases on the cloud, and use real data science tools. In the final project, you will analyze multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate your skills.
